# Dokkanpanion Project State

**Last updated**: 2026-08-10

This is the concise operational checkpoint for future sessions. Durable
decisions live in [`adr/`](adr/), and current workflow instructions live in
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md).

## Repository Checkpoints

- `D:\Dokkan\DokkanWebScraper` owns the TypeScript data pipeline.
  Its integrated history includes E0–E9, H0–H13, F0–F6 and M0–M6, together
  with the DB0–DB50/C1–C5 database-first foundation.
- This history line also contains the reviewed K0–K9 character-productization
  checkpoint, reapplied in order from the historical campaign and followed by
  artifact-path hardening. Exact branch pointers remain operational Git state,
  not a durable project-state assertion.
- The historical `codex/database-character-productization` branch remains
  intact as the original campaign record.
- `D:\Dokkan\Dokkanpanion` owns the Android consumer. Its synchronized
  `master` checkpoint remains `fe58fe1`; no database-first shadow consumer is
  implemented or authorized.
- The project uses Codex exclusively. Provider-neutral workflow, verification,
  repository and publication rules are defined in `AGENTS.md`.

## Database-first Foundation

- Character and Team Analysis DB0–DB50 and integration C1–C5 are integrated as
  one dependency-complete unit from the `ba29759` checkpoint.
- The database-first sidecar is optional, additive, absent-compatible and
  disabled by default. Production generation, contracts, publishers, R2 and
  Android do not consume it.
- `supported`, `partial` and `unknown` remain distinct. Supported-only
  projections exclude every partial/unknown dimension; joins use structural
  IDs rather than names or localized text; provenance is field-scoped.
- The durable decision remains
  [`ADR-0005`](adr/0005-use-an-optional-database-first-team-analysis-sidecar.md).

## Current Campaign Checkpoints

### E0–E9 — events, stages, enemies and bosses

- E0–E9 `1.0.0` is complete, experimental, optional and non-production.
- E9 permits only reviewed disabled infrastructure and generation with the
  exact audited profile. Scraper replacement, R2, Android, event screens,
  beneficial-character calculation and boss/damage simulation remain NO-GO.
- E9 payload SHA-256 is
  `f7a111572485e0c55758a186d753e40eebf59f2de4c262c192a5ad5cf0cf781c`;
  the full sequential refresh was deterministic and peaked at 847,204,352
  bytes, below 1 GiB.

### H0–H13 — offline server captures

- H0–H13 is integrated as offline, additive, default-off capture evidence.
  It adds no credential acquisition, replay, scheduler, publisher, Android
  consumer or production switch.
- H12 remains two GO decisions (reviewed disabled infrastructure and ignored
  sanitized local fixtures) and five NO-GOs: authenticated refresh, scraper
  replacement, R2, Android shadow mode and FYI/DokkanInfo retirement.
- H13 corrects H11 without changing H0–H10: the 627 unique gasha facts are 612
  representation mismatches and 15 coverage gaps, with zero confirmed
  conflicts. The former 1,254 count is a non-exclusive comparison-cell total.

### F0–F6 — Frontier capture audit

- F0–F6 is complete as offline-only, additive, default-off and fail-closed
  evidence. It cannot replay or automate battle traffic.
- Only disabled infrastructure and synthetic fixtures are GO. Real-body
  decoding, E0–E9 replacement, Android, R2, automated refresh, protocol
  consumption and replay/automation remain NO-GO.
- F6 artifact SHA-256 is
  `6280ec896beda1150df84a1933f6f76ece28e278ba47a310922cfac6d28c8f63`;
  two reconstructions were byte-identical and peak memory was 488,800,256
  bytes.

### M0–M6 — Pettan/Burst special-mode captures

- M0–M6 is complete with current evidence as optional, offline-only,
  default-off infrastructure. It has no request/replay/mutation, Android, R2,
  publisher or production capability.
- Only disabled infrastructure and synthetic fixtures are GO. Pettan battle,
  Burst gameplay/scoring, opaque start configuration, E/S/H replacement,
  Android, R2, production and request/replay automation remain NO-GO.
- M6 artifact SHA-256 is
  `bc4978334f5ad14f68b4af9e502a250cc2ede9bff74e572516c0a68b86fd0751`;
  two reconstructions were byte-identical and peak memory was 258,596,864
  bytes.

### K0–K9 — reviewed character productization checkpoint

- K0–K9 evidence, contracts and matching compiled outputs are present on this
  history line. The infrastructure remains optional, additive,
  absent-compatible, default-off and non-production; no Android, R2, publisher
  or productive dataset was added.
- Only merging the disabled infrastructure and pinned optional generation are
  GO. Every authority promotion or consumer path remains NO-GO, including
  production replacement, FYI/DokkanInfo removal, asset delivery, Android,
  Team Builder and combat calculation.
- K7 preserves the four field-scoped conflicts rather than selecting a winner:
  FYI reports `maxLevel=120` and `maxSALevel=10` for EZA cards `1027621` and
  `1028161`, while first-party EZA step-7 growth rows report `140` and `15`.
  Both snapshot/state/growth-row provenances remain explicit.
- Dynamic acquisition and availability remain server-owned; asset delivery,
  portrait/card-art roles, unproved presentation mappings and runtime/combat
  semantics remain unknown or unsupported.
- K9 payload SHA-256 is
  `db0f86e858b091521ab72ae72b89d2531abb0fcd1bf684877bcb991197d5ff85`;
  K0–K9 generation evidence is deterministic and every recorded peak stays
  below 1 GiB (K1 is the maximum at 899,956,736 bytes).

### K10–K14 — field-scoped character product shadow

- K10–K14 is complete on the isolated
  `codex/database-character-shadow-projection` branch and is not integrated,
  published or consumed by Android.
- The optional shadow contains 109,421 field projections over 5,759 database
  cards, preserves 4,296 production joins and 1,463 unjoinables, and creates no
  `Character` records or production writes.
- `id`, `rarity` and `type` satisfy field readiness; `rarity` and `type` are
  the meaningful first migration candidates. All authority remains unchanged,
  and FYI/DokkanInfo remain active.
- The four K7 conflicts on `1027621` and `1028161` remain unresolved and retain
  exact EZA growth-row provenance. They are not K0-K2 value inputs.
- K11 payload SHA-256 is
  `a71b2202902bf7702ba3724c6431b16e907bcb858e6aa4a826c919a2f9257722`;
  two complete generations were byte-identical and peak RSS was 626,032,640
  bytes.

## Operating Constraints

- Read this checkpoint before reconstructing broader project context.
- Keep verbose output in ignored `.agent-logs/` and start with focused checks.
- Do not commit generated `data/`, SQLite, ELF, APK or raw capture artifacts;
  keep only matching tracked `lib/` output for changed TypeScript sources.
- Treat commit, push, R2 publication and Android changes as separate actions
  requiring explicit authorization.
- Run an R2 publisher dry-run and inspect projected bytes before any upload.
- Preserve unrelated user changes in both repositories.

## Maintenance Rule

Update this file after a major integration, publish, cutover or user-visible
milestone. Keep low-level evidence in the relevant report/specification and
create or supersede an ADR when a durable decision changes.
